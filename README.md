# NFT Game

NFT Game implementation in Solidity.

#### Game

Players must initially mint one of the three pirates, choose carefully since you can have only one per account. 

After selection, you'll advance and fight the boss. Be careful, for each attack of your character the boss will counterattack. Keep attacking until only one stands. In case of failure, sorry, at least you have weakened the boss.

#### Implementation

The main contract _Game.sol_ inherits from ERC721 OpenZeppelin implementation.
